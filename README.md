# Valo-site
I will be creating a website using the MERN stack. The front end will be written in React.js, the backend will be written in Node.js using the Express framework, and lastly the database we will use will be mongoDB. This website will allow users to search the username of Valorant players and pull up their stats. Stats revolving around kills, deaths, agent usage, etc.
